# Beyond Robotix Air Data Module

This is the firmware for our AUAV based combined airspeed and altitude sensor!

Designed to aid fixed wing UAVs in GPS denied environments. Typically, internal barometers on autopilots are affected by pressure changes inside the UAV airframe. By using a static pressure reference from a pitot tube, barometric altitude estimation can be much more accurate.
